00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:08.000
are brand-new tips to help you have the 
best possible experience at EDC in 2025.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.520
What’s up rave fam, I’m Joe, your 
Rave Tour Guide! I help ravers like  

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.200
you get the most out of their EDC 
experience. If you’re new here,  

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.600

content! And if you want even more tips,  

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.320
check out my previous first-timer guides. I’ll 
leave the links in the description box below.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.440
Tip 1: Trade Kandi with Other Headliners

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.480
Kandi trading is an amazing way to connect with 
your fellow headliners. Don’t be afraid to ask  

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.440
someone if they want to trade—whether you’re at a 
stage, resting at a table, or walking throughout  

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.880
the festival. I believe some of the best moments 
happen when you share a bracelet that represents  

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:52.640
your new connection. Like a piece of kandi with a 
special word or phrase that captures the moment.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.480
Tip 2: Use a Totem for Easy Navigation

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.840
If you’re in a group, a totem is a must. It makes  

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:17.440
it way easier to find your 
crew and move through crowds.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.240
Tip 3: Catch a Surprise Set

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.440
Some of the best sets at EDC 
aren’t even announced! Last year,  

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:39.680
we caught Fred again’s first-ever EDC set 
— it was my favorite set of the entire  

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.560
weekend! This year, there’s rumors of an 
ISOKNOCK set, possibly at circuitGROUNDS!

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.960
Tip 4: Check Out Activation Experiences
Big brands bring out freebies, unique drinks,  

00:01:50.960 --> 00:02:04.240
and pop-up stages—like Dunkin’ last 
year! If they bring back Dunkin’ again,  

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.120
it’s definitely worth checking out.
Tip 5: Explore Downtown EDC 

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:14.000
Beyond the main stages, places like the 
YeeDC Country Saloon offer their own vibe,  

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.160
bar, and lineup. And, if there’s a line at the 
experience you want to do, don’t hesitate—it’s  

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.880
worth it. Last year I didn’t do the Kandi 
Casino because I thought the lines were long,  

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.640
only to find out they took 15-20 minutes. If I 
would have known, we would've definitely waited.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.840

Tip 6: Make EDC Your Power-Up!

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.440
EDC isn’t just a festival—it’s a launchpad for 
your next level. Before you go, take a moment  

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.520
to recognize how far you’ve come. After EDC, 
don’t let that energy fade—channel it into your  

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:10.320
life and goals. The most successful people don’t 
just experience transformation—they plan for it.

Tip 7: Watch Intermissions at kineticFIELD

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.160
EDC’s biggest stage has insane production—and  

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:36.160
you can see it all in action during 
intermissions and the closing show.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.800
Tip 8: Stay Until the End (At Least One Night!)

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.440
Day 2 is the best day to stay 
‘til the end—the vibes are unreal,  

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.600
and kineticFIELD’s closing show is 
the perfect way to end the night.
