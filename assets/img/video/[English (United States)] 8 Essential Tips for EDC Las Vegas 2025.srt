7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,440
Tip 1: Trade Kandi with Other Headliners

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,480
Kandi trading is an amazing way to connect with 
your fellow headliners. Don’t be afraid to ask  

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,440
someone if they want to trade—whether you’re at a 
stage, resting at a table, or walking throughout  

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,880
the festival. I believe some of the best moments 
happen when you share a bracelet that represents  

11
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:52,640
your new connection. Like a piece of kandi with a 
special word or phrase that captures the moment.

12
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,480
Tip 2: Use a Totem for Easy Navigation

13
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,840
If you’re in a group, a totem is a must. It makes  

14
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:17,440
it way easier to find your 
crew and move through crowds.

15
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,240
Tip 3: Catch a Surprise Set

16
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,440
Some of the best sets at EDC 
aren’t even announced! Last year,  

17
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:39,680
we caught Fred again’s first-ever EDC set 
— it was my favorite set of the entire  

18
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,560
weekend! This year, there’s rumors of an 
ISOKNOCK set, possibly at circuitGROUNDS!

19
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,960
Tip 4: Check Out Activation Experiences
Big brands bring out freebies, unique drinks,  

20
00:01:50,960 --> 00:02:04,240
and pop-up stages—like Dunkin’ last 
year! If they bring back Dunkin’ again,  

21
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,120
it’s definitely worth checking out.
Tip 5: Explore Downtown EDC 

22
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:14,000
Beyond the main stages, places like the 
YeeDC Country Saloon offer their own vibe,  

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,160
bar, and lineup. And, if there’s a line at the 
experience you want to do, don’t hesitate—it’s  

24
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,880
worth it. Last year I didn’t do the Kandi 
Casino because I thought the lines were long,  

25
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:30,640
only to find out they took 15-20 minutes. If I 
would have known, we would've definitely waited.

26
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,840

Tip 6: Make EDC Your Power-Up!

31
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:57,440
EDC isn’t just a festival—it’s a launchpad for 
your next level. Before you go, take a moment  

32
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,520
to recognize how far you’ve come. After EDC, 
don’t let that energy fade—channel it into your  

33
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:10,320
life and goals. The most successful people don’t 
just experience transformation—they plan for it.

Tip 7: Watch Intermissions at kineticFIELD

37
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,160
EDC’s biggest stage has insane production—and  

38
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:36,160
you can see it all in action during 
intermissions and the closing show.

39
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,800
Tip 8: Stay Until the End (At Least One Night!)

40
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,440
Day 2 is the best day to stay 
‘til the end—the vibes are unreal,  

41
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,600
and kineticFIELD’s closing show is 
the perfect way to end the night.
